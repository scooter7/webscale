Subject: Financial Aid at ECU

For many students, financial aid is an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to paying for college. Our Office of Student Financial Aid provides education, guidance and support to individuals and families who need financial help. Aid for qualifying students is available through federal, state and institutional programs.
 
To apply for financial aid, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). We recommend you complete the FAFSA by ECU's priority deadline of March 1, or as soon as possible thereafter. Funds are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Since approximately 78% of our students receive some form of financial assistance, we strongly encourage all families to complete the FAFSA.
