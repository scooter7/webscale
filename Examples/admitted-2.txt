Subject: Experience the diversity of Pirate Nation. 

[FirstName], from the moment you step foot on campus, you will feel the welcoming spirit that is so much a part of our university. That same spirit contributes to an important aspect of your ECU education: meeting and interacting with individuals of various cultural, ethnic and geographic backgrounds. Opportunities for these experiences abound at ECU and are interwoven into your academic and extracurricular activities. 

ECU has over 500 registered student organizations, including a number of self-identified cultural organizations, religious groups and Greek Life fraternities and sororities. Because of ECU's commitment to diversity and cultural exploration, students live and study in a multicultural environment in which they learn as much from their peers as they do in the classroom.
