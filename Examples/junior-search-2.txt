Subject: Visit ECU 

The best way to get to know ECU is to visit. We invite you to join us for a campus tour where a current student will show you around our beautiful campus and share what it's like to be a Pirate. 

Or, visit ECU virtually: 

• Register for a virtual info session. Join us for a live information session presented by an admissions counselor, followed by a Q&A session. You can also view our on-demand video info sessions at any time. 
• Take our virtual tour. Main Campus and Student Life tours are available. 
• Schedule an appointment with an admissions counselor. Use our tool to find your admissions counselor and then schedule a phone appointment by clicking the link in their bio. 

We hope to see you in person or online soon!
