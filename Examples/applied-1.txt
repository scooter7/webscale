Subject: We take the call to serve seriously. 

The motto of East Carolina University is Servire, a Latin word meaning "to serve." It is more than a directive - it's a passion, a way of life. Each year ECU students provide over 28,000 hours of service to community partners around the region. They serve in many ways, including through their work in dental clinics in North Carolina's underserved regions and by developing programs to bring communities together through artwork. 

As an ECU student, you will discover how service can improve the lives of many - including your own.
