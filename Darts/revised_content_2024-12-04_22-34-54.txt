Dear Person-Preferred,

At The College of Idaho CofI, we understand that money matters to you, just as it matters to us. We believe everyone should be cared for and encouraged in their educational journey, and we're dedicated to assisting you in achieving your academic goals affordably and confidently.

Alyssa Johnson, a member of our class of '24 in Environmental Studies History, embodies this commitment. Because of my scholarships at The College of Idaho, I have had incredible experiences. I've traveled the world - gone to Greece and Spain aboard research vessels - and I will graduate debt-free.

To ensure every student can have a similar enriching experience, CofI offers a variety of scholarships

- Merit Scholarships Ranging from 12,000 to 22,000 per year, these do not require a separate application, and you are automatically considered upon admission.

- Application-based Scholarships While these require additional steps, such as an extra application and sometimes an interview, the potential rewards are substantial, making the effort worthwhile.

- The Heritage Scholarship This prestigious scholarship covers full tuition for students with exceptional intellectual ability and grants automatic admission to the Gipson Honors Program.

- Horatio Alger Scholarships Designed for students with demonstrated leadership potential or academic excellence, these scholarships also address critical financial needs in students who have shown perseverance through adversity.

By blending these opportunities with outside scholarships and student employment, you can achieve a truly affordable college experience.

It all starts with your application. Start your scholarship process today so you, too, can have life-changing experiences at CofI.

It's Time to Apply

Warm regards,

The College of Idaho Admissions Team
