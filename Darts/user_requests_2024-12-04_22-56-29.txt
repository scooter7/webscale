“Because of my scholarships at The College of Idaho I have had incredible experiences…I’ve traveled the world - gone to Greece and Spain aboard research vessels -  and I will graduate debt-free.” 
-Alyssa Johnson, '24 Environmental Studies & History 

Because money matters to you, {{Person-Preferred}}, it also matters to us.

That’s why we offer scholarships recognizing everything from your academic achievement to your talents. Take a look:


•	Merit scholarships range from $12,000 to $22,000 per year and do not require a separate application—you will be automatically considered when you are admitted to the College. 


•	Application-based scholarships require an additional application, and some also involve an interview process. But with more scholarship dollars on the line, the extra work is well worth it.


•	The Heritage Scholarship provides full-tuition scholarships to highly qualified students with exceptional intellectual ability. Eligible students are also automatically admitted into the Gipson Honors Program.


•	Horatio Alger Scholarships focus exclusively on academic achievement or leadership potential. They are also intended for promising students with critical financial need who demonstrate integrity and perseverance in overcoming adversity and are determined to succeed.

Add talent, outside scholarships, and student employment to this list, and you have a completely affordable college experience. 

It all begins when you submit your application. Start your scholarship process now by applying today.
